Introducing Python Internship Scraper, an efficient web scraper designed to collect valuable internship data from Internshala.com's Python track. 
This script leverages the power of BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to navigate through multiple pages and extract essential information about each opportunity.
By running this script, users can gather insights into the latest Python internships available at Internshala.com, sorted by recency, providing them with a comprehensive overview of opportunities tailored to their interests.

Note: 
While this script demonstrates how to use BeautifulSoup and requests, it doesn't utilize scapy, which is a network packet manipulation toolkit not directly related to web scraping. 
However, the naming convention may have been chosen due to the similarity between "beautifulsoup" and "scapy."
